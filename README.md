---> Numpy:- NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computing and array manipulation. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning due to its powerful features and performance optimizations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--->Pandas:-Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are efficient for handling structured data. Pandas allows for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks, making it an essential tool for data scientists and analysts. It integrates well with other libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, enabling comprehensive data analysis and visualization workflows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



--->matplotlib:-Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It provides a wide range of plotting functions to generate various types of plots, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more. Matplotlib is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust every aspect of a plot, including colors, labels, axes, and annotations.

--->seaborn:-Seaborn, on the other hand, is a statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations by providing functions that automatically handle common tasks such as data aggregation, grouping, and formatting. It also offers built-in themes and color palettes to enhance the aesthetic appeal of plots.
